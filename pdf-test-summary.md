## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Upload a PDF
The app can process PDF files through the upload interface. Files are converted to text using `pdf-parse`.

### 2. Ask Questions
Once uploaded, the PDF content becomes available as context for the AI assistant.

### 3. Get Answers
The AI uses the extracted PDF content to provide accurate, context-aware responses.

## üß™ Test Files Created

You now have several test files to verify PDF functionality:

1. `test-pdf-standalone.js` - Basic PDF parsing test
2. `test-pdf-context.js` - Context building simulation
3. `test-pdf-workflow.js` - Complete workflow test
4. `test-pdf-simple-extract.js` - Simple text extraction
5. `test-pdf-api.js` - API endpoint testing (requires running server)
